## Service Level Agreement (SLA)

| SLO                              | SLI (Measurement)                                                                                                                | Target               | Measurement Window                                                          | Error Budget            | Alert Threshold       | Rationale                                                                                                             |

| Website/App Uptime               | Ratio of successful health checks to total checks (uptime = (total time - downtime)/total time)                                  | 99.5% per month      | 30 days, excluding maintenance (max 4 hours/month announced 48 hours prior) | 0.5% (~3.6 hours/month) | <99.5% over 7 days    | Ensures availability for order placement; inspired by food delivery SRE practices. Metrics: up_gauge from Prometheus. |
| Order Visibility to Partner      | Percentage of OrderPlaced events visible to partners (e.g., via API/Kafka) within threshold; measured as 99th percentile latency | 99% within 5 seconds | Per hour, aggregated daily                                                  | 1%                      | >5s for >1% of orders | Critical for preparation start; from DDD events (OrderPlaced). Metrics: histogram_order_visibility_latency_seconds.   |
| Delivery Notification Latency    | 95th percentile time from status change (e.g., OrderInTransit) to notification sent                                              | <10 seconds          | Per hour                                                                    | 5%                      | >10s for >5%          | Keeps customers informed; from scenario (SMS/app updates). Metrics: histogram_notification_latency_seconds.           |
| Agent Bonus Calculation Accuracy | Percentage of BonusAwarded events matching rules (e.g., based on reviews, value)                                                 | 100%                 | Audited monthly                                                             | 0%                      | Any discrepancy       | Ensures profit margins (bonuses < fees); from ubiquitous language. Metrics: counter_bonus_accuracy_errors_total.      |
